## Description
___________

Taking a tour into Data Science to learn a bit more about the field and tools used in this space
____________
## Feature Tasks and Requirements
___________

1. Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Show the first five rows of the data set.
3. Show the description and the info of the data set.
4. Ensure that any date columns have been cast into a datetime object in your DataFrame.
5. Using a regression model, split your data into train and test data.
6. Fit your training split to the regression model.
7. Show your regression modelâ€™s score.
8. Draw at least three conclusions from your regression model.
Questions to draw conclusions:  
- How does residual sugar affect sensory rating (1-10) of quality of wine?
- How does % alcohol factor into sensory rating (1-10) of quality of wine?
- How does citric acid ("freshness") correlate to sensory rating (1-10) of quality of wine?
- How does volatile acid ("vinegar") correlate to sensory rating (1-10) of quality of wine?

## Dataset
_________

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
   3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)
   4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)
   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
   8 - density (g / cm^3)
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
   11 - alcohol (% by volume)
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

   ** g/dm^3 is grams per volume of a liquid solvent/solution
